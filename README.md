The ALX Simple Shell Team Project represents a collaborative initiative focused on crafting a Shell program named "hsh." Utilizing the power of the C language, shell, and Betty linter, the project endeavors to create a user-friendly interpreter for the UNIX command language. With hsh, users can effortlessly execute commands sourced from a file or standard input.

At its core, hsh functions by presenting a clear and interactive command prompt, patiently awaiting input from users. Once a command is entered, hsh employs a child process to validate it, seamlessly replacing the child process with the desired command and its accompanying arguments. Following execution, the program gracefully returns to the parent process, promptly displaying the command prompt anew, all set to receive additional user instructions.

Beyond its fundamental capabilities, hsh proves its mettle by effectively handling built-in commands, seamlessly navigating through aliases within the path, and effortlessly executing local executable programs. Its adaptability shines even in non-interactive modes, rendering it a versatile and indispensable tool for various scenarios. The ALX Simple Shell Team Project's hsh is an embodiment of efficiency, simplicity, and user convenience.
